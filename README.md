# prophet-challenge

## Description
In this project, I looked into whether thereâ€™s a connection between how often people search for MercadoLibre on Google and how its stock performs. 

I went through the search data and stock prices to see if any patterns stood out. The project included finding unusual spikes in search traffic, checking if there were any regular patterns over time, and using a tool called Prophet to predict future search trends. 

The goal was to see how understanding search traffic could help in making better stock trading decisions for MercadoLibre.
